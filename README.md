**Insurance Cost Prediction using Machine Learning**

This project aims to predict insurance costs using machine learning techniques. We employ three different algorithms—Linear Regression, Gradient Boosting, and Random Forest—to estimate the cost of insurance based on various parameters.

**Project Overview**

The goal of this project is to develop a predictive model for insurance costs using machine learning. The models are trained and evaluated based on several key features:

* Age <br/>
* Sex <br/>
* BMI (Body Mass Index) <br/>
* Number of children <br/>
* Smoking status <br/>
* Residential region <br/>
* Features <br/>

The dataset includes the following features:

* Age: Age of the individual (numeric) <br/>
* Sex: Gender of the individual (binary: male/female) <br/>
* BMI: Body Mass Index (numeric) <br/>
* Number of Children: Total number of children/dependents (numeric) <br/>
* Smoking Status: Whether the individual smokes or not (binary: yes/no) <br/>
* Residential Region: Current residential region of the user (categorical) <br/>

**Algorithms**

We apply the following machine learning algorithms to predict insurance costs:

1. Linear Regression: A linear approach to modeling the relationship between the dependent variable (insurance cost) and one or more independent variables.
   
3. Gradient Boosting: An ensemble technique that builds models sequentially, with each new model correcting errors from the previous one.
   
3. Random Forest: An ensemble method that constructs multiple decision trees and merges them together to get a more accurate and stable prediction. <br/>
